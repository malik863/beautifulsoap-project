## H2 Project: ATP Tennis Rankings Scraper
This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract ATP tennis player rankings from the Fox Sports website and save them in a structured CSV format. The script utilizes Python libraries such as requests for fetching the webpage content, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and extracting relevant data, and pandas for organizing the data into a tabular format. The extracted data includes player names, rankings, and other related information. The final dataset is saved as tennis-rankings.csv, which can be used for further analysis or integrated into data-driven applications. This project demonstrates basic web scraping techniques and data manipulation using Python, making it suitable for learning purposes and quick data acquisition tasks.
